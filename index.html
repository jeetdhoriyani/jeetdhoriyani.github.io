<h2>Research Interests</h2>
My research interest lie at the intersection of Machine learning and Quantum computing. I am interested in working on use of Hybrid Quantum Classical problems to solve large scale industry problems. I am excited to apply Quantum computing in graph based machine learning problems and networks. I believe there are networks all around us and extracting information from such networks Quantum Algorithms can help us with speed ups in many known problems.

<h2>About</h2>
<p>I am a second year M.S. Student in Cornell University, fortunate to be part of <a href="https://www.peese.org/">PEESE Research group</a>.<br><br>Prior to joining Cornell, I have worked at Accenture consulting as a Application Analyst. At Accenture, I was introduced to world of CRM software and Software as a Servic(SaaS), I enjoyed my tenure working on cross continental team, designing digital solutions for the client. I obtained my Bachelor's from one of the oldest engineering school of India the L.D. College of Engineering, India.</a>.</p>

<h2>Software</h2>
We have published two codes for the NequIP and Allegro potential. Both are public on our group's Github. If you have questions, please reach out, we are happy to help: 

<ul>
  <li> <a href="https://github.com/mir-group/nequip"> NequIP</a>, MIT license </li>
  <li> <a href="https://github.com/mir-group/allegro"> Allegro</a>, MIT license </li>
</ul>

Both of these also come with a LAMMPS pair_style, which can be found here:
